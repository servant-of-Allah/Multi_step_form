### What I learned

During the development of this project, I had the opportunity to work with React and Tailwind CSS, which proved to be valuable tools for creating a multi-step advanced form app. The project presented numerous challenges that allowed me to expand my understanding of React and Tailwind CSS while also enhancing my overall knowledge of these technologies.

Some key takeaways from this project include:

1. **React**: Through building the multi-step form app, I gained a deeper understanding of React's component-based architecture and its ability to efficiently manage complex user interfaces. I learned how to create reusable components, handle state management, and navigate between different steps of a form. This project provided hands-on experience in effectively utilizing React's features and concepts.

2. **Tailwind CSS**: Working with Tailwind CSS enabled me to streamline the styling process by leveraging its utility-first approach. I discovered how to rapidly prototype and style components using Tailwind CSS classes, resulting in a more efficient and maintainable codebase. By utilizing its extensive utility classes, I learned to create responsive layouts and implement custom styles to match the project's design requirements.

3. **Vite**: I utilized Vite as the build tool for this project, which offered a fast and efficient development experience. Vite's quick startup time and hot module replacement greatly improved my productivity during the development process. Integrating Vite into the project enhanced my understanding of modern build tools and their ability to optimize the development workflow.

Overall, this multi-step advanced form app provided an exciting and challenging opportunity to apply my knowledge of React and Tailwind CSS. The project not only solidified my understanding of these technologies but also expanded my skill set in handling complex functionalities and managing different states within a web application.
